**WELCOME TO THE BOB BAKER MARIONETTE THEATER** 

Nestled below a freeway overpass at a precarious intersection in Los Angeles, the Bob Baker Marionette Theater (BBMT) has hosted performances for the young and old since 1963. The space itself is not only a theater, but also a warehouse (where 3,000 puppets are stored), a party room (used for children’s birthdays, events and work-shops), an office (for the part-time directors and staff), in addition to an archives (previously used as a creative studio and library by Bob Baker during his lifetime). Intentionally built to function like one of the old Hollywood studios that Bob often worked for, the archives includes a wealth of paratextual material he used to create his characters and design the Theater’s productions. Today, these materials are used to understand how to execute existing productions, as well as perform and create new ones. For this reason, the reference materials within the archives are constantly moving in and out of the space, sometimes even being transformed into completely new work.

Walking into the Bob Baker Marionette Theater one realizes that nothing is static within this whimsical space. Envisioned, built and maintained with the imagination, dedication and self-determination of a small revolving group of puppeteers, people often comment that they feel transported out of time or everyday life when they are at the theater. Before a show, puppeteers rush around vacuuming the carpet, meticulously decorating tables with streamers, brewing fresh coffee in the kitchen, and rehearsing their routines backstage. Upon closer examination of the space, the ceiling lights are made from coffee cans, disco balls hang next to gaudy chandeliers, walls are painted to look like stage curtains and the floor of the courtyard is painted green with daisies. Everywhere you look there is a creative solution or inventive construction that personifies the can-do attitude that has carried the theater along for over 55 years. For a theater that exists in continual motion, and is now officially moving its entire holdings and operation to a new physical location, how do archivists preserve the original order of this theater’s history? 

**FIRST ARCHIVISTS ON THE SCENE**

For the past two years, we have worked as the Theater’s first archivists while attending UCLA’s MLIS program. Adam was initially drawn to the Theater through previous work in entertainment and puppetry arts, while Brianna became involved due to interest in working with the Theater’s ¼” open reel audio collection, and background working with artist spaces. Although we both originally started as volunteers, we were eventually awarded funding in the summer of 2018 through the UCLA Community Archives Lab—a project funded by the Mellon Foundation which awards stipends to MLIS students working with community spaces in Southern California. This funding has allowed us the time and resources to manage the Theater’s collections more thoroughly over the past year by documenting the sentimental nature of the space and its collections, as well as creating workflows and systems to maintain physical control of the Theater’s archives during the move. Originally, the Theater’s archives functioned as Bob Baker’s creative studio, which was physically separated from the rest of the theater on a lofted mezzanine level behind a locked door. Since Bob’s death the archives has slowly become accessible to the internal staff, puppeteers, and community members whose personal connection with the space has deepened as a result. With this access, the paratextual materials that make up the vast majority of this collection now serve to instruct the Theater community about the various facets that went into producing Bob’s shows. Within this collection are puppets, oral histories, concept art, picture files, books, magazines, records, cassette tapes, ¼” open reel audio tapes, analog videotapes, films, digitally-born videos, as well as business records and personal documentation on paper. 

In the beginning, we grappled with trying to understand if there was an order to the space and what sort of order might need to be preserved. With a lack of documenta-tion, and those who worked with Bob to build the theater being elderly or deceased, we were left with many questions as to his intent and creative vision. This issue is compounded by the theater’s imminent move to a new space, since knowing the order (and what should or should not be recreated in a new location) is imperative under these circumstances. To compensate for this, we interviewed over 20 community members from various generations over the past couple of years, in an attempt to document what can be remembered about the space, and any original order which may still exist. With what we’ve learned, we will describe the complex identity of this community archives and the challenges a kinetic space such as this brings with it, in relation to maintaining original order while moving an entire archives. 

So how does one preserve the idea of place when you must physically relocate it? Even with a signed lease for a new space, it is unclear what the reimagining of the theater will look like with so much that remains to be seen. Although it will continue to be a successful space for gathering, educating, and performing, the Theater must also retain ownership of the records and materials that symbolically describe and identify its history and community. As stewards of this archives, we recognize that just having a space with objects in it is not enough—it is the context and history of this space that imbues them with their worth. In an attempt to grapple with the daunting task of moving an entire communi-ty archives, while maintaining the integrity of its identity, we decided to document the physical arrangement of the archives before anything was moved. Records of this arrangement were then incorporated into the inventory templates and unique identifiers given to the theater’s holdings at the collection and item levels. 

Below is a list of the projects we designed to incrementally apply this workflow in loose chronological order: 

**Establishing physical control**

- The space was documented photographically, with 2D and 3D maps, as well as with a VR rendering. 

- Inventory templates were created on Google Sheets with examples of proper data entry, so volunteers could assist with inventory creation where needed. Depending on the collection’s preservation priorities these inventories varied in detail. 

- The collection was mapped and shelves were labeled with unique identifiers that corresponded to the format, collection, and location from which it was being moved. To do this with volunteers, we also created rubrics for boxing procedures. 

**Consulting with other archival professionals** at the Getty Research Institute, 20th Century Fox Archives, The Walt Disney Company, and Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences about best practices and to get feedback on procedures and workflows we wanted to implement. 

**Conducting an audit of the Theater’s archives** that established collections by format, calculated linear and cubic feet, approximated totals for each of the collections’ holdings, and provided recommendations for archival storage and housing. 

- These metrics enabled us to calculate how many boxes we needed for packing and to budget for these expenses. 

- We also believe this material could be used in the future to create a finding aid. 

**Creating project lead positions** (a.k.a other dedicated volunteers who could serve as point people if we were not there) with designated duties and a loose hierarchy of responsibility. 

**Setting a timeline for packing** that adhered to the tight move schedule that was slated for early April. This timeline broke up the archives by format-specific collections, starting with smaller less fragile ones, and ending with larger collections that required volunteers with art handling or archival experience to pack. 

**IN CLOSING**

Although moving poses numerous challenges, it has also provided many benefits due to the positive change it introduced. As a result of having to pack the theater’s archives, the staff has been compelled to assess the collection’s value with us. During this process, conversations have begun about how to define the scope of the collection, as well as implement accession and deaccession policies. To manage these issues, we are in the process of forming a Collection Committee, who will determine these policies as a group consisting of members of the theater’s staff and community. 

Taking on the new roles of archivists within an organization that has never had one before, we’ve learned many lessons through trial and error. Although we have both managed components of collections within an archives previously, neither of us have been solely in charge of an entire archives. For this reason, we both feel extremely fortunate to have each other as sounding boards, and also to share the workload. We believe that having each other for professional and emotional support while managing such a personal collection, has been paramount to our success in laying a sustainable foundation for the theater’s library and archives.
