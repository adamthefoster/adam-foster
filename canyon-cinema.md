# Canyon Cinema Foundation
## A service organization for local geniuses

***

In 2013, I volunteered at [Canyon Cinema](https://canyoncinema.com) where I learned to inspect and repair 16mm films. During this time, Canyon was transitioning to non-profit status. Staff worked together to gather clips from artists in the collection, which I then edited into this short video to be used for outreach for board members.
