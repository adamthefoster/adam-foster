## WCanyon Cinema Foundation - a service organization for local geniuses

Through 2013, I volunteered at Canyon Cinema through where I learned to inspect and repair 16mm film. During this time, Canyon was transitioning to non-profit status. Staff worked together to gather clips from artists in the collection, which I then edited into this short video to be used for outreach for board members.
