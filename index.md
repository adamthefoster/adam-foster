## About Me

Hello! I'm a media archivist working in Public Access. In my work I specialize in the creation and delivery of digital moving image assets for exhibition, research, and licensing requests at the Academy Film Archive. I have 7+ years of experience working in collectionâ€™s management at arts non-profits, distributors, government, and studio archives.

My current research focuses on the conservation and preservation challenges of exhibition objects. Specifically, I am working with new lighting techniques used to restore color faded museum objects and applying them to the exhibition of color faded film collections.

This site attempts to compile my relevant projects and helpful resources if interested in audiovisual archives and preservation.
