## About

Hello! I'm a media archivist working in Public Access. I specialize in the creation and delivery of digital moving image assets for exhibition, research, and licensing requests at the Academy Film Archive. I have 9+ years of experience working in collectionâ€™s management at arts non-profits, distributors, government, and studio archives.

My research focuses on the conservation and preservation challenges of exhibition objects. I'm currently working with new lighting techniques used to restore color faded museum objects in order to apply them to the exhibition of color faded film collections.

This site compiles my relevant archives work/projects and more, as well as helpful resources for those interested in similar areas of moving image archives and preservation.
