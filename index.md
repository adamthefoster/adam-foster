# **About**

***

Hello! I'm a moving image archivist working at the Academy Film Archive. I specialize in the creation and delivery of digital moving image assets for exhibition, research, and licensing requests within the Public Access Department. I have 9+ years of experience working in collectionâ€™s management at arts non-profits, distributors, government, and studio archives.

My research focuses on the conservation and preservation challenges of exhibition objects. In addition to working with archival film and video, I'm currently working with new lighting techniques used to restore the color of faded feathers with colleagues from the Getty Conservation Institute and UCLA/Getty Conservation Program.

This site compiles my relevant archives work/projects and hopefully additional resources for those interested in similar areas of moving image archives and preservation.
