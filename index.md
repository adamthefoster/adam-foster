## About Me

Hello! I'm a media archivist working in Public Access. In my work I specialize in the creation and delivery of digital moving image assets for exhibition, research, and licensing requests at the Academy Film Archive. I have 7+ years of experience working in collectionâ€™s management at arts non-profits, distributors, government, and studio archives.

My current research focuses on the conservation and preservation challenges of exhibition objects. Specifically, I am working with new lighting techniques used to restore color faded museum objects and applying them to the exhibition of color faded film collections.

I have a Masters in Library and Information Science with a focus in Media Archival Studies from UCLA and hold a B.A. in Film and Digital Media Production from UCSC. I previously worked with the Bob Baker Marionette Theater as their Head Archivist during their relocation to Highland Park. I've held mentorships at Canyon Cinema and the Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum, and internships at 20th Century Fox Archives and the UCLA Film & Television Archive.
