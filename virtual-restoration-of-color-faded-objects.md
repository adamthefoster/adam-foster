# Virtual restoration of color faded objects

Since 2020, I've been researching alongside Vincent Laudato Beltran (Scientist, Getty Conservation Institute)Â and Ellen Pearlstein (Professor Emerita, UCLA) to virtually recolor faded feathers and faded bird specimens. 

Our team has prestented at the Society of the Preservation of Natural HIstory Collections (SPNHC) in 2023, and will be showcasing more work in 2024 at the Western Association of Art Conservation {WAAC} and the Association of Tribal Archives, Libraries and Museums (ATALM) meetings/conferences.

In 2023, the Getty's YouTube program, Becoming Artsy, created the following short video introducing the various concepts and details of our research.
